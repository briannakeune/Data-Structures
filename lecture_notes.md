Runtime- a way to measure code effiency
Time != Big O
  ^
  | is very hardware dependent.


Big O is a measurement for code that is hardware independent.
Big O allows us to use some standards to measure how effciency 
mathmatically an algorithm is by the steps used to run the program.
~ Counting the number of operations.

-- Does the number of operations scale based on the input? -> How?

Big O wants us to think of measuring algos in the 'worst-case' scenario.
